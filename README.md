### (=^ï½¥^=)

I'm a 17 y/o (she/her) tackling postpartum hemorrhage in Jigawa, Nigeria. Previously, I was on the Advanced Analytics teams at CIBC, one Canada's largest banks (5th by market cap). Before that, I was the youngest person on the Cyber team at KPMG Canada. Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ShifraKhan)!
